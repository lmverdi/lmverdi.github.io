<p>He thinks that man is me,
he knew him at a glance.
The stranger he has found,
This man could be my chance.
Why should i save his hide?
Why should i right this wrong?
When i have come so far,
And struggled for so long.
If I speak, i am condemned,
If i stay silent i am damned.
i am the master of hundreds of workers,
they all look to me
can i abandon them, how would they live
if i am not free?
if i speak, i am condemend
If i stay silent i am damned...
